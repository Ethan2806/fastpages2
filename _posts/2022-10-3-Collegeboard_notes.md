# 1.4 College Board Video Notes

# 1.4.1
- Errors are innevitable in programming
- In errors in an algorithm or program, there are 4 types of errors:
    - Logic Error:A mistake in the algorithm that causes it behave incorrectly or unexpectedly
    - Syntax Error: A mistake in the program where the rules in the programming language are not followed
    - Run-time error: Mistake in the program that occurs during the excecution of the program. Dependent on the language. Usually refered to as a bug.
    - Overflow error: error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.

# 1.4.2
- Understanding how to correct errors is essential to programming
- Best ways to correct errors
    - Test cases
    - Hand tracing
    - Visualizations
    - Debuggers
    - adding extra output statements.
- The syntax error is usually the easiest error to fix
    - it tells the programmer which line and what the error was.
- Logic errors are difficult to find and fix.

# 1.4.3
- Programmers should come up with testing schemes to ensure that their program works.
    - Identify inputs and correspondng exprected outputs or behaviors check the correctness of the algorithm or program.
- Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different exprected outcomes that are at or just beyond the min and max of input data
- Program requirements identify appropriate defined inputs for testing.
- As soon as they start programming, they should constantly be testing.

# Hacks 
- We could have many syntax errors, becuse most of my group is not expirienced with coding in any language.
- After we manage to create the code for the journal we will do test runs of every mood, category and journal type.
- If we do expirience any bugs, we will converse as a group, discuss with classmates, search up on google, or ask the teacher for assistance to fix it.
- We will rerun the code evertime we add something to ensure that it works.
- Our steps to testing will be 1: Code the interface, 2: code the journal, and 3: code the lists, making sure to test and document evertime.
